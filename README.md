# Sinatra Project - Movie Jars

Hello! This is my Sinatra project, Movie Jars!

This app is based off of a real-life problem my family and I have. We'll sit down to watch a movie, and we'll scroll forever through Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, etc. unable to pick a movie we all want to watch. Our solution? Write down every movie we want to watch, and put it in a jar. When we want to watch a movie, we draw from the jar and watch that movie.

My app works very similarly. After you sign up, you can make multiple jars, and you can fill those jars with movies. Then, you can 'draw' a movie from a jar. You also have options to edit and delete jars and/or the movies in your jars.

## Installation
